# intro-SQL-basics
This project does not include Front-end or Back-end Code but instead it is focusing on setting up a database with **SQL**.
The database could be used for teastaurants and reviews on these restaurants.

## Idea of data:
We need 2 tables for Restaurants and Review
1. Restaurants
   - Unique ID
   - Name
   - Address
   - Type

2. Review
   - Unique ID
   - Reviewer Name
   - Rateing
   - Text
   - Date

The tables shoould also be connected
